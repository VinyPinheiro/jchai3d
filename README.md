JChai3d
=======

The JChai3D project is the Java implementation of theCHAI3D library, which was developed at University of Stanford.

JChai3D provides rendering mechanism and a interface to communicate with haptic devices (like ForceDimension's Omega.x, Sensable's Phantom and others.

As features, it provides:

- 3D rendering mechanism using OpenGL (via JOGL);
- Simple scene creation. You'll just need a few lines of code;
- Hardware abstaction for haptic devices. You can attach haptic devices with two or three lines of code;
- Force-feedback algorithm, as the original CHAI3D library.

Originally this projects had as its goal to bring the CHAI3D experience to browsers, but as long as wee develop we noticed that the performance of JCHAI3D were quite good, almost the same speed as its parent.

At the present moment, you can develop it with ease beacause it's a Maven project.

Regards!
